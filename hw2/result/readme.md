##Result csv files

There are two result files in this directory, "output.csv" is generated by the script file "hw2.py", and "output_no_comma_last_column.csv" is generated by "hw2_no_comma_last_column.py".

I made two results in that the hw website asks us to add comma at the blanks, but only without the comma, we can make the csv file a good version showing in github
