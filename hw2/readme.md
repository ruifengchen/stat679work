#Homework 2

##Instruction
The main purpose of this Homework is to merge two files. Matching two file firstly, and then putting the energy_value in [energy.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/hw2-datamerge/energy.csv) to the additional column in [waterTemperature.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv), and some format need to change to satisfy the homework requirement.

the working directory is hw2

##Data
[Data](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/tree/master/hw2/hw2-datamerge) contains two main files [energy.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/hw2-datamerge/energy.csv) and [waterTemperature.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv).

The energy.csv file contains two columns:

- Date/Time

- Energy Produced (Wh)

The waterTemperature.csv file contains three columns:

- "#"

- Date Time, GMT-05:00

- K-Type, °F (LGR S/N: 10679014, SEN S/N: 10679014, LBL: water pipe)

##Script
[Script](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/tree/master/hw2/script) contains two main files "hw2.py" and "hw2_no_comma_last_column.py"

- [script/hw2.py](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/script/hw2.py)

- [hw2_no_comma_last_column.py](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/script/hw2_no_comma_last_column.py)

The difference of them are showing at [script/readme](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/script/readme.md) and also [result/readme](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/result/readme.md)

The are almost the same except that file "hw2.py" generates the csv file with comma at the last column in the blanks, but the file "hw2_no_comma_last_column.py" doesn't.

##Result
[Result](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/tree/master/hw2/result) contains two main files "output.csv" and "output_no_comma_last_column.csv"

- [output.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/result/output.csv) is generated by script "hw2.py"

- [output_no_comma_last_column.csv](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/result/output_no_comma_last_column.csv) is generated by script "hw2_no_comma_last_column.py"

##Execution
Here in order to get the output file, I ran

- "python script/hw2.py hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv hw2-datamerge/energy.csv result/output.csv"

- "python script/hw2_no_comma_last_column.py hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv hw2-datamerge/energy.csv result/output_no_comma_last_column.pycsv" respectively in the terminal.

In a word, the main sentence is：

**python script argument1 argument2 output_file** or

**python script argument1 argument2** (with the output turning to STDOUT stream)
