## HW2 scripts

This directory contains two scripts for HW2. The are almost the same except that file "hw2.py" generates the csv file with comma at the last column in the blanks, but the file "hw2_no_comma_last_column.py" doesn't. The purpose is also shown in [result/readme](https://github.com/ruifengchen/stat679work/blob/master/hw2/result/readme.md)

In order to get the output file, we should run "python script argument1 argument2 output.file" in the terminal.

Here in order to get the output file, I ran
"python script/hw2.py hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv hw2-datamerge/energy.csv result/output.csv" and
"python script/hw2_no_comma_last_column.py hw2-datamerge/waterTemperature.csv hw2-datamerge/energy.csv result/output_no_comma_last_column.pycsv" respectively.
